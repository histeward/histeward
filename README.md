## This is me :)

Hi! Stew here üç≤

I used to make pictures for a living and now I'm here aspiring to be a part of tech and innovation.

When I was 12 years old I got my first experience with a computer. Because youtube existed already back then, I learned how to do cool stuff with bash making a cool matrix script or using the command line to remotely shutdown a pc in the same network with a scary message pretending to be a ghostü§£ Meanwhile i picked up html css to make basic websites. sadly I haven' done much after since it was not well encouraged back in middle school. After that most of my life was dedicated towards exercise and health.

Because of my interest in exercise and health, I started studying biomechanical engineering in uni. That's where I picked up matlab and further started to explore into programming languages again. Eventually I picked up python because I could do analysis with it same as matlab. And it was free. Eventually i transferred to Mechanical engineering as a major. That's when I further got into math and physics. When we had a project where we had to use recursive equations to get a value that dictated our design to make a scaled down static construction crane. It got so tedious that using python to do it for us was like the ultimate tool for laziness hahaha. For future projects in the same format it came in handy to add some more functions and finish the assignment like that.

Eventually I dropped out to pursue a career of making videos and photos for online marketing purposes for companies that wanted to expand their reach on the internet. It became a pretty big thing over the years and it motivated me to keep on pursuing this career path. Until the pandemic came around and everything just stopped. I was just clueless on what to do. Eventually I messed around again with python and some other languages. I started building basic websites again and learned a bit about back end with python and flask.
